# mango-examples
This project is created to show some examples on how to integrate an anchor project and mango.
Currently I have implemented following features : 
  1) Initaite mango account.
  2) Deposit funds into mango account.

I will also try to implement withdraw and check pnl methods.

## Build
build command : anchor build
test command : anchor test

Anchor test will deploy this program on devnet and test it with the tests written in typescript by default.
